# Prework Guide #

This humble guideline is meant for TA's and LT's so they efficiently review preworks without getting lost on the way and so they dont spend more time than needed.

Once the students have handed in their prework, you'll see the links on the **control panel**, right at the *PREWORK* tab.

There you'll find the links of every student to their **HTML/CSS** and **JS**, along with a cell to write some comments about the review for each exercise.

Once you start checking out someone's prework, fill the cell of that student's name with some color (at the control panel spreadsheet) to let other TA's know the review of that particular student has already begun and they will have to pick someone else. This is useful to avoid more than 1 TA reviewing the same prework.
Once the review is done, fill the student's name cell with the original color (white)

## Basic aspects to check about the prework ##

### HTML/CSS ###
  * Does it look like the example?
  * Is there a overuse/misuse of Id's?
  * Is it well indented?
  * Do they target the elements in an efficient way? e.g:
        
           .container h2{
                    color: grey
                }
  * Do they use classes the right way?

### JS Challenge ### 

  * Does it work?
  * Do they define functions that don't use?
  * Is it well indented?
  * Do they use ES6 syntax?
  * DO they **understand** how or why they're using parameters/aguments  in their functions? Notice that some of them will create a function     passing parameters that they never use when they call the function. This leads to errors or misunderstandings.

Regarding the bonus, the usual way of adding more rovers is with a array of rovers and the usual way of adding obstacles is either with an array of obstacles OR hardcoding the obstacles in a hardcoded grid.

If the student has not requested 1on1 review, send them a mail with your feedback.

## 1on1 prework review ##

Some students will ask to meet you, either in person or hangouts, to review their prework. Keep in mind that is easy for them to confuse "prework review" with "lets do my prework together!". Its understandable because they can get lost during the prework but our approach should be to **guide** the student to the solution (and this applies to the course too)

If they come with the basic Rover, give them some feedback and if they have questions about the bonus part, try to give them the hints/tools (forEach, rovers array, obstacles array).

If the student comes with a very well done challenge and ask very basic questions, try to find out why they did it like this. Some students might find the solution on google and, even if googling is a very good skill, it will be helpful to know if they did not do it themselves.

Feel free to add or modify this document for future usage.

Good luck!
